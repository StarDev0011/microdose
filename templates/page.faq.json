THC can build up within your system and cause a drug test failure.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fortunately, the federal government permits the allowance of THC derived from hemp under 0.3%, which means consuming THC is now a right of US citizens.  Many employers will not go out of their way to explain this to their employees, but it is something we strongly encourage you to share with your friends & family. We believe everyone should be informed on this topic so that they can enjoy the benefits of hemp-derived THC.<\/span><\/p>",
